    <h2>thoughts on progressive enhancement</h2>
    <p>
      Progressive enhancement allows all users to have an enriching experience where everyone is
      allowed the chance to interact with content on websites.
       Progressive enhancement is a modern and more acceptable way to design. 
       Think about it... Why design something that will give users drastically different experiences depending on 
       what device it's viewed on(like graceful degradation)?
       So progressive enhancement is important for all around accessability.
     (A youtube link I found interesting that talks about progressive enhancement)

  <h2>Dragon Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>Feedback: I asked my mom and my sister what I should do differently to make the draft more pleasing.
     Initially they both told me to change the entire website... With this being one of my first few websites,
     I asked them what "big changes" would pull together the site. Both of them agreed that I should 
     make the images on the site smaller, darken the website colors to further match the space aesthetic, correctly place the logo, and 
     try to make the website "fit" onto the page. I took the advice and made the images smaller, added borders, and used text align
     to center some of the elements on the page to create more unity, changed the colors to a darker blue, and added a logo(logo was tough but I think I got it).
     If I had to start over I think that I would have planned ahead more than I did. I would've planned ahead what exactly 
     the website was to look like with figma. I thought I had a good design outcome all planned out in my head, but I overestimated that design.

  <p>Semester Thoughts: I enjoyed the class. I did have trouble at first, 
     but I was quickly caught up with the help of the TA and professor. I enjoyed the little homework assignments the most, 
     specifically the flexbox froggy assignment. I feel that before this class I overcomplicated HTML and CSS.
     I look forward to taking the skills I learned in this class, building upton them, and using them in the future.
